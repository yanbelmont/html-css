            Lo! ’t is a gala night<br>
            Within the lonesome latter years!<br>
            An angel throng, bewinged, bedight<br>
            In veils, and drowned in tears,<br>
            Sit in a theatre, to see<br>
            A play of hopes and fears,<br>
            While the orchestra breathes fitfully<br>
            The music of the spheres.<br>
        </p>

            Mimes, in the form of God on high,<br>
            Mutter and mumble low,<br>
            And hither and thither fly—<br>
            Mere puppets they, who come and go<br>
            At bidding of vast formless things<br>
            That shift the scenery to and fro,<br>
            Flapping from out their Condor wings<br>
            Invisible Wo!<br>
        </p>

            That motley drama—oh, be sure<br>   
            It shall not be forgot!<br>
            With its Phantom chased for evermore<br>
            By a crowd that seize it not,<br>
            Through a circle that ever returneth in<br>   
            To the self-same spot,<br>
            And much of Madness, and more of Sin,<br>   
            And Horror the soul of the plot.<br>

            But see, amid the mimic rout,<br>
            A crawling shape intrude!<br>
            A blood-red thing that writhes from out<br>  
            The scenic solitude!<br>
            It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs<br>
            The mimes become its food,<br>
            And seraphs sob at vermin fangs<br>
            In human gore imbued.<br>

    <section class="normal">
        <p>
            Out—out are the lights—out all!<br>
            And, over each quivering form,<br>
            The curtain, a funeral pall,<br>
            Comes down with the rush of a storm,<br>
            While the angels, all pallid and wan,<br>
            Uprising, unveiling, affirm<br>
            That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”<br>
            And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.<br>
